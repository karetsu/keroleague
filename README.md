This is a leapfrog ladder league, with character lock. You must play the character or team you registered with.

All sets are a FT5/BO9 format.

The initial ladder will be randomly populated. It does not take long for this to settle.

Each week you can challenge one person. This has to be somebody of a higher rank than yourself. 
Every player can also receive two challenges from players ranked lower than themseleves. This means you will play, at most, 3 competitive sets in the ladder each week.


Challenges are to be DM'd to the organisers before 7pm on the Monday of every week, as well as any mention of known inability to play in the coming week. Announcements of the sets to be played will be made on Tuesdays to give time for matchup practice.


Matches will be co-ordinated so that as many as possible, and reasonble, are broadcast on https://twitch.tv/raisedbyfinches or https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCXQaNu6HS_5b93-GFSN3tRw. Logistics of this stream will be arranged shortly, it is not anticipated that it will begin before 19h00 BST/GMT every Friday.


Some matches will not be streamed to due to the volume of challenges. These can be played at players' discretion any time during the week of the challenge before the end of each Sunday. Results are to be reported to the organisers. 


Each person can only be challenged by two people per week (to prevent first place having to just play endlessly), a suitable alternative will be found if you miss out on the challenge and are all at organiser's discretion. It will typically be the next player in the ladder who has not already maxed out on challenges.


In a multiple challenge scenario, the results are applied in ascending order of the sum of ranks. So if rank 2 is challenged by ranks 3 and 4, and loses to both, then irrespective of the order of play the rank 4 result is applied after the rank 3 result meaning that of these three players, the order is now: 3, 4, 2. It sounds more complicated than it is and will become clear in application.


The ladder is expected to run for 8 weeks. You are not expected to play every week, however you are expected to make one challenge once per month unless you are top.
